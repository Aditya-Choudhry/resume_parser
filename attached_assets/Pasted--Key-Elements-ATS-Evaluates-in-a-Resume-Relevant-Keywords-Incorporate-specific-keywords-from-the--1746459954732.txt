üß© Key Elements ATS Evaluates in a Resume
Relevant Keywords

Incorporate specific keywords from the job description, including skills, qualifications, and job titles.

Use both full terms and common abbreviations (e.g., "Search Engine Optimization" and "SEO").

Place these keywords naturally within your resume's content.

Clear Section Headings

Use standard headings like "Work Experience," "Education," "Skills," and "Certifications."

Avoid creative or unconventional headings that might confuse the ATS.

Simple Formatting

Use a clean, straightforward layout without graphics, tables, or columns.

Stick to standard fonts like Arial, Calibri, or Times New Roman.

Avoid using headers, footers, or text boxes, as ATS may not read content within them.

Appropriate File Type

Submit your resume in a format compatible with ATS, such as .docx or .pdf (if specified).

Avoid using image-based formats like .jpg or .png.

Chronological Order

List your work experience in reverse chronological order, starting with the most recent position.

Include employment dates and ensure consistency in formatting.

Quantifiable Achievements

Highlight accomplishments with measurable results (e.g., "Increased sales by 20%").

Use bullet points to present achievements clearly and concisely.

Education and Certifications

Include details of your educational background, degrees earned, and relevant certifications.

Specify the institution names and dates of completion.

Contact Information

Provide your full name, phone number, email address, and LinkedIn profile (if applicable).

Ensure this information is placed at the top of your resume for easy visibility.

Tailored Content

Customize your resume for each job application by aligning your experience and skills with the job requirements.

Avoid using a generic resume for multiple applications.

Avoidance of Unreadable Elements

Refrain from using special characters, emojis, or complex formatting that ATS might not interpret correctly.

Ensure all text is selectable and not embedded within images.
